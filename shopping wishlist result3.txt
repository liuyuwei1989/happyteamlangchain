**Jira User Story**

**Type:** Story

**Title:** Implement Wish List Feature for Easy Product Tracking

**Description:**

As a frequent online shopper, I want to be able to easily create and track my wish lists on the retail website so that I can save products I'm interested in for later purchase and easily share my lists with friends and family. 

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Create Wish List:**
   - Users can create multiple wish lists (e.g., Birthday Gifts, Holiday Shopping).
   - Each wish list can be named and edited by the user.
   - Users can add products to any of their wish lists from the product detail page via a prominent "Add to Wish List" button.

2. **View Wish Lists:**
   - Users can view all created wish lists in a dedicated section of their account.
   - Each wish list displays the product names, images, prices, and availability status.

3. **Track Wish List Items:**
   - Users can mark items as "purchased" or "not interested" directly from the wish list interface.
   - Users can receive notifications if an item in their wish list goes on sale or is low in stock.

4. **Share Wish Lists:**
   - Users can generate a shareable link for any of their wish lists.
   - Users can send wish lists via email or social media platforms.
   - Shared wish lists can be viewed by recipients without requiring them to log in.

5. **Manage Wish Lists:**
   - Users can delete wish lists or remove individual items from a wish list.
   - Users can move items between wish lists.

**Additional Context:**

- **User Persona:** The target user is a tech-savvy online shopper who frequently browses products and prefers to plan their purchases ahead of time. They value convenience and social sharing capabilities.
- **Competitor Analysis:** Review similar wish list functionalities on competitor sites to identify best practices and unique features.
- **Performance Metrics:** Success will be measured by the number of wish lists created, the frequency of items added/removed, and user engagement with shared links.
- **Technical Considerations:** Ensure the feature integrates seamlessly with existing user accounts and product inventory systems. Consider potential scalability issues if wish lists become widely adopted.

**Dependencies:**
- User account management system
- Product database for availability status
- Email and social media integration for sharing functionality

**Potential Tasks:**
- Design UI mockups for the wish list feature.
- Develop backend APIs to handle wish list creation, editing, and sharing.
- Implement front-end components for displaying and interacting with wish lists.
- Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the usability of the feature.
